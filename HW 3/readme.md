For this assignment, I created 2 seperate folders, "HW 3" is my design, and "HW 3 - Gemini" was the generated files I got from the Gemini AI, where I copied and pasted the prompt from the homework assignment, and added that "complete this prompt in any way you see fit. you have an index.html file, a script.js file, and an "images" folder should you need it. 

If you open mine, it's a little bit more colorful, and also a little bit more basic because I was more focused on the JavaScript portion than the HTML portion. The AI's version was clean for the most part, but also a little bit more clinical feeling, as it used greys and whites with it. 

When it came to their answers for the console.log prompt, they had some interesting answers. Mine, while maybe not as interesting, actually felt like me. 

If you relied only on AI-generated outputs, or someone elses' work, you wouldn't be able to get the sense of pride from learning from it. It's just there. Yeah, mine may seem simple, but hey I like my aquamarine background and my Ray Volpe plaing on my headset. 

Because I did the prompt after I did my own work, I would mostly explain the code that Gemini wrote, but if it was reversed I probably coun't tell you a whole lot outside of the comments it put in there.

My final work feels like me, the Gemini's work does not at all. Like for example, chess is not a game I enjoy very much. And Elden Ring? Are they okay?
