                Howdy there! I'm Brittany. First off, I apologize about my very basic website, I'm still trying to learn a bunch of stuff here. A little bit about me, I'm currently a junior at the University of Montana, studying Cybersecurity.

        <h2>Make Sure to Touch Grass!</h2>
        <p>
            While it can be super fun to play video games all day, and trust me, I've been there and done that, make sure to actually go outside on occasion. There's a whole lot to do! If you love the winter, go hit the slopes! I've decided that picking up snowboarding after being a skier all my life was a great idea, still working on not falling on my face constantly. If you're more a fan of the warmer months, go fishing, hiking, camping, or hit up Kettlehouse for some rocking concerts! Montana has fresh air, big skies, and mountains all around you. So, for the sake of both your mental and physical health, make sure to get outside and touch some grass!

        <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up heavily as a military brat, moving a whole lot as a kid, and then also moving around as an adult with the Army. Couple years ago, I decided that I was tired of moving, and wanted to go to school as well. I started off studying Computer Science, but then figured with my background that Cybersecurity would blend a little bit better. Once I graduate, I want to looking into penetration testing and incident response. When I'm not at school or at work (those bills gotta get paid), I like to do things that take my mind off of the stressers of life. I play video games with my friends, snowboard, camp, and fish. I'm also attempting to gather as many hoodies from rock concerts as I can, mainly from bands that dominiated the early 2000s.

            <h2>Unity Through Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                So, I was pretty much raised on video games. My dad was a huge gamer, and as a kid he would keep me occupied with them while he was away at work. One of those games was World of Warcraft. I remember playing on my dad's account, just running around and having absolutely no clue what I was doing. Twenty-ish years later....I'm still playing World of Warcraft, and I've made some of my dearest friends through there. Mind you, I have actually never met any of these people in real life, mainly because we're all across the US and Canada and airplane tickets are expensive. We all come from different backgrounds as well, where some are engineers, some are dispatchers, and some are other full-time students. But, without World of Warcraft, I wouldn't have these friends that have seen me through some really rough patches of my life, and I wouldn't have been able to be there for them when they needed me. Gaming has a way of bringing people together, and I'm super grateful for that.
