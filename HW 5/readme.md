So I allowed free reign on HW 5 - Gemini, where I entered the homework prompt directly into Google Gemini, other than stating what files it had to work with: index.html, script.js, an images folder (if needed), and a style.css if it wanted it. 

I will give it credit, the styling going for it was pretty cool. Very theme-fitting, as you're playing as a courer in a cyberpunk like era. 

However, it failed to meet the requirements of 5 choices. Or perhaps I misread this, I believed that you had to have 5 total choices no matter which options you did (which reflected in a VERY long JavaScript), and not just 5 total options. 

I think overall I could potentially use it more for design purposes, as my design is very simple in nature, but you have to be incredibly specific on what you want for it to work.
