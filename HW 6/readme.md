So mine I was having a little bit of issues with the math random part, even after reloading my html page a couple of times, it seems like the images are fairly close together. For example, on row 1, the second tile can be the chicken, but it seems like third tile is then also the chicken, instead of appearing in a different row. It does not do this for all the images, but it was something I noticed while I was running through the page repeatedly seeing if I could break it. 

As for this week's Gemini (I've been using Gemini because I've noticed it's a little bit more creative with not having super strict prompt input), I feel like it took a little bit of a step back from last week. Last week's themes were super cool, while this one is kinda.....meh. It meets the requirements, partically. It created a 4x3 grid, it involved the tile flipping if you click on it, but the lag is pretty signicant. Also, there's no actual images? It might've been because I told it to source its own images, but make it school appropriate, because I did not know what it was going to pull up to be honest. This is kind of where I'm confused on where the lag is, because there are no actual images within the JS. There are placeholders, with text, but no images.
